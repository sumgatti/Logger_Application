The customer value is the keystone for effective product marketing activities. It brings together customer intelligence, competitive insight, and product valuation. It delivers a concise, supportable statement of the customers value. It quantifies how that value is realized based on all of the target customers likely interactions and experiences and billed consumption. The customer value provides a focused approach to understanding the target customer in the context of our tarriffs.
The major activities that bear on the revenue and profitability potential of customers: (1) the effort to acquire new customers, 
(2) the challenge of retaining them, and (3) the various means of increasing their value.

The model is built in Data Lake using Hive (SQL-like tool that allows us to run in a distrubuted fashion on Hadoop cluster).
Data Model runs once in a month and it's used to create monthly reports/dashboards.

We have a repository from different data sources streamed into lake on daily basis and for this vaue model some of the below 
customer data points are used. 

Customer Base data 
Customer consumption and billing rates over the previous 12 months before model is run
All payments data 	 
ACD call data-Agent costs
IVR call data-Costs of system
Dunning	cost of printing / postage
Existing outstanding debits / credits	 
switching data	Number of new connections/ acquisitions by FOTS/ telesales/Web
Retention sales	number of retention sales in the past year by FOTS/ telesales/Web
Emails contacts	Admin costs
Meter readings	Admin costs - only where admin team inputs reads
Instalment plans setup	Admin costs
PAYG installed	broken down by liberty / lifestyle
SPAYG installs	install costs
Ebiller Data- Reduces costs of printing / postage of bill

Apart from the above , we also have fixed or static financial data provided by finance team.


The value is calculated per customer at contract account level, whose consumption is annualized and whose costs are based on a 
12 month summary of all transactions.
VALUE = CONTRIBUTION - (Fixed Costs + Marginal Costs + Debt)

The monetary value amount categorized into 10 deciles, so the customer can fall into any of the 10 value deciles (H1, H2, H3, M1, M2, M3, M4, L1, L2, L3)
H1 – top 10% of value
L3 – lowest 10% of value


Final value models created will be : 
•	customer_value_month :  the aggregated value per month that each customer has incurred in any of the activities
•	customer_value_year  :  the aggregated value per year that each customer has incurred in any of the activities
•	customer_value_ledger : is a ledger of all the bills, balances, payments, costs that customers have incurred
